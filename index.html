    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Ramya, a passionate and dedicated MERN Stack Developer with a solid foundation in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
      I recently completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (2023) and a comprehensive Full Stack Development course, which helped me strengthen my backend and frontend development skills. 
      I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive solutions. I’m constantly learning and growing, and I believe in building clean, efficient, and scalable applications. 
      My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects, continuously upgrade my skills, and evolve as a confident and skilled developer. 
      I also believe in balancing work with a calm and creative life, and I see every day as an opportunity to improve both professionally and personally.
